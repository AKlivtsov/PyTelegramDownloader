# PyTelegramDownloader
 Jsut a little thing to mess up with telegramm client api

 ## How to use
 1. create venv with python 3.12.3 (i use pyenv to do it, so do you)
 2. install requirements.txt
 3. create .env file with API_KEY and API_HASH (you can get it from my.telegram.org)
 4. add to .env SUPER_DUPER_IMPORTANT_CHAT_ID (or name it as you want). It's a chat id where you want to download messages, voice, photos, videos from.
 5. run main.py
 6. enjoy

 ## What's next?
 Maybe add some kind of user interface to choose chat id and download media from it, or just create cli-client for telegram.
